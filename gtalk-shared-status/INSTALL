These are general instructions to build and install my purple plugins.

LINUX:

To build the plugin you have to install gcc, GNU make, pkg-config and pidgin 
developing dependencies (or maybe only libpurple if in your os they are 
distribuited separately). I.e. in Debian/Ubuntu, open a terminal and type:

sudo apt-get install gcc make pkg-config pidgin-dev

then to build type:

make 

to install (default directory is ~/.purple/plugins) type:

make install

You can also create a compressed tar by typing:

make tar



WINDOWS:

It's hard for non experts to build the plugin in Windows so the best solution
is to download the binary directly from site.

If you feel brave you have two ways and all of them explained in 

http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Scripting%20and%20Plugins#HowdoIcompileapluginWindows

where there's written to setup a build environment like that in 

http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuildingWinPidgin

I've included the Mingw Makefile that I use to build my plugins for Windows.
