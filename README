This plugin adds Google Shared Status support to Adium.

Currently it only works with Adium 1.7 nightlies. I will fix this later.

This uses gtalk-shared-status libpurple plugin code by Federico Zanco, obtained from
http://www.siorarina.net/gtalk-shared-status/ . This code is licensed under the GNU GPL V2.0 or later.

The rest of the code is my own, and is in the public domain. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
